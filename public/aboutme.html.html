
<p>I have worked on a few projects. I have gained experiences<br/>
 like how to manage and complete a project timely, how to gather and <br/>
 analyze data & prepare them for report, and how to do advanced work with<br/>
  a computer system using different softwares. It also helped me to enhance <br/>
  my verbal & written communication, time management and problem solving skills. <br/>
  Beside that, I have seven plus years of experience teaching Physics and <br/>
  Mathematics to school level students of different curriculums. Years of <br/>
  teaching and dealing with different students helped my analytical skill <br/>
  to develop. I am now learning Web Development and I am truly enjoying it.<br/> </p>
